## ✨ Overview

**cube3D** is a lightweight **3D raycasting engine** written in **C**, built as part of the 42 curriculum.  
It renders a **pseudo-3D environment** from a 2D map by simulating how rays interact with walls, creating depth, perspective, and immersion.

The project focuses on:
- Low-level graphics
- Mathematical precision
- Real-time rendering
- Smooth player movement and animation
